      <h3>Humzah Chowdry</h3>
      <p> Hello, my name is Humzah Chowdry and I'm a student of City, University of London. I am studying Computer Science the main programing experience that I had before the coding Bootcamp was with a program called Visual Basic, which includes more dragging and dropping than coding so doesn't really compare to the work that I have been able to accomplish within the Bootcamp.g.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Days Gone</h3>
 <p>My first programming project, concluding the 2-week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of arrays, loops, and classes.</p>
<p>My project is a forest that changes depending on the position of the sun and the moon. There is also a bird that flies past in the beginning and it has an audio file that is attached to it. After some time it also begins to rain and I created the rain through the use of an array and a class. There is also an audio file of trees in the wind and rain when it begins to fall. If you look carefully you will also be able to see that the trees are actually growing every time that rains and one tree grows at a faster rate than the others.</p>

    <p>Check out the code on Github: <a href="https://github.com/HumzahC/adbt103.git">https://github.com/HumzahC/adbt103.git</a></p>
